# Privacy Policy
## Stored Data
All data collected and stored by this extension is stored in your computer's browser except the extension settings which are synced across your devices using the browsers internal syncing capabilites (if it's activated). Data is not synced to a cloud service or to a third party local or remote application. You can at any time clear all collected data and settings from the Extension Options page. 

## Browser permission 
Web Time requires access to certain functions of your browser and access to some external websites. These permissions are carefully selected, and Web Time would not function without these. The following permissions are required: 
- "activeTab"
To get information (e.g. hostname) about the current active tab. 
- "tabs"
To get information (e.g. hostname) about all active tabs in all open windows. 
- "webNavigation"
To detect when a URL changes so that a new session can begin. 
- "storage"
To store your settings and collected data. 
- "notifications"
To notify you when you reach your daily limit
- "unlimitedStorage"
The amount of data stored in the local storage can exceed the limitation if this permission is not included. 
- "<all_urls>"
To be able to collect data from any visited hostname, this permission is required. 

## Browsing history
Web Time stores some data about where you've visited recently. Specifically, the hostname, visitation date/time and the duration of the visit. You can always clear this data from the Extension Options page. Note that the exact URLs of the visited pages are not stored.
